# Huffman_file_compression
This project is a demonstration of text file compression and decompression using the Huffman encoding technique, implemented in the C programming language. Huffman encoding is a popular method used for lossless data compression.

# Introduction
This project was developed as part of the Information Theory and Coding class. The aim was to implement Huffman encoding for compressing text files efficiently. Huffman encoding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, resulting in compression.

How Huffman Encoding Works
Huffman encoding involves the following steps:

Frequency Calculation: The frequency of each character in the input text is calculated.
Building the Huffman Tree: A binary tree is constructed where characters are stored at the leaf nodes. The frequency of each character determines its position in the tree.
Generating Huffman Codes: Huffman codes are generated by traversing the tree. Left branches represent '0', and right branches represent '1'.
Compression: The input text is encoded using the generated Huffman codes.
Decompression: The compressed data is decoded back to its original form using the Huffman tree.
